# mcdonalds_dataset_challenge

This is the result of a challenge for EDA-ing the McDonalds Menu Dataset, which available in Kaggle. I do this as part of online scholarship training program called Digitalent, specifically the Data Scientist Program. The challenge is quite simple. There are 5 questions pertaining the dataset, and you need to answer it using analytical skills and data science tools.
